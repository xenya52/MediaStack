### Planning

Building the fundermental features while keeping the code clean and maintainable. Is the main focus of this version.

Furthermore I wanna ensure that the application is easy to extend in the future, so I will try to follow best practices and design patterns.

I wanna mention that I try for education purposes to code with the test driven development (TDD) approach, so a little disclaimer at this point that the code may contain some bugs.

#### Features

- [x] Upload images, videos, and PDF files
- [x] Overview of all stored media
- [ ] Display images directly in the browser
- [ ] Embed PDF files in the browser
- [ ] Play videos
- [x] Delete files via the UI
- [x]️ Store metadata such as filename, type, and upload timestamp

#### Expected timeframe

Total timespan: 2025-05-29 -> 2023-06-12 (two Weeks)

**Week 1:**

1. 29.05 - Time Planning and Project Setup (1h)
    - Create a new Spring Boot project with Vaadin
    - Set up SQLite database connection
    - Create initial folder structure and class diagram
    - Create initial README.md file with project description and TODOs
2. 30.05 - Implement test cases for the MediaFile model, Implement MediaFile model and repository, create SQLite database (2h)
    - Change Java version to 23 because of Vaadin 24 and Java 17 makes no sense for me because I do not need to refactor anythin up
    - Create Tests for MediaFileModel, MediaFileModelBuilder and MediaFileDirector because I wanna use the builder pattern for my Model with multiple properties and Constructor
    - Add lombok to the project for easier model creation and reduce boilerplate code
    - Create MediaFile model with properties like id, name, fileType, uploadDate, and path
    - Add dependency for validating my model with annotations like @NotNull, @NotBlank, etc.
    - Add JPA API, JPA Implementation and JDBC with starter-data-jpa to the project
    - Create MediaRepository interface for CRUD operations on MediaFile
    - Create Builder and Director for MediaFile model to simplify object creation
    - Add SQLite database dependency to the project (sqlite-jdbc)
    - Add SQLite dialect plugin to the project for JPA
    - Add SQLite database configuration to application.properties
3. 31.05 - Implement test cases for MediaService, Implement MediaService with upload and delete functionality, create service interface (2h)
    - Fix the MediaFileModel with adding a @AllArgsConstructor and @NoArgsConstructor annotation for the Builder and Director pattern
    - Removed @SpringBootTest annotation from the MediaFileModelTests because it is not needed to get the full Spring context loaded
    - Add a application.properties to the tests and rename the root gradle.properties.kts file to application.properties
    - Adjust the MediaFileModel with more percistence and validation annotations, furthermore add lombok toString() annotation
    - Edit the id in MediaFileModel to a Long type and add @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY) annotation to it
    - Fixed expected String test for MediaFileModel
    - Add LocalDateTime to the director parameters and adjust tje director tests for that
   ---
    - Create tests for MediaService with JUnit 5 and Mockito for get, upload and delete functionality
    - Implement MediaService with methods for getting, uploading and deleting media files
    - Change MediaFileModel in Director to use the current date and never set a id because it is generated by the database
    - Adjust the MediaFileModel Director tests for the new changes in the Director class
    - Create dumby MediaFiles in Mock up database for the MediaService tests
4. 01.06 - Implement test cases for MainView, Implement MainView with upload and delete functionality, create UI components (2h)
    - Add a default view to get into vaadin, worked after the first run
    - Setup AppShellConfig for vaadin to use the correct theme and icons
    - Create a config folder for the ShellConfig
    - Add a Header and a coloring button for deeper understanding of the Vaadin framework
    - Add multible functions to the MainView
        - setupUplad() has the functionality to upload files
        - getFileType() determines the file type based on the file extension
        - setupGrid() sets up the grid to display media files
        - refreshGrid() refreshes the grid to show the latest media files
    - Add tests for MainView with JUnit, but afterwards what was a mistake because of my TDD rule
5. 02.06 - Implement file upload, deletion functionality (idk i think there a no tests possible form my view now), Implement file storage in the local file system (1h)
    - Didnt happen
6. 03.06 - Bug fixing and code cleanup, looking for potential patterns (1h)
    - Didnt happen
7. 04.06 - A short User Manual / Documentation and final touches (30 min)
    - Didnt happen
- 04.6 - Adjust Readme.md, Add a file storage service, No db caching anymore, work with TDD (2h)
    - Already implemented the file upload and deletion functionality in the MainView, so I just need to add the file storage in the local file system
    - Add tests for MediaFileStorageService to ensure file storage works correctly
    - Add a MediaFileStorageService to handle file storage in the local file system, and add every .db to the .gitignore file
    - Put MediaDatabase from a temporary cache to a SQLite database in my project root
        - jdbc:sqlite:memory:myDb?cache=shared -> jdbc:sqlite:media-stack.db, and ddl-auto is set to update
    - Make a final MediaFileService Attribute for MediaFileStorageService to handle file storage
    - Addjust the README.md file with a short user manual and documentation
    - Total not needed at this point because everything works as expected
        - (Note: Consider improve the user experience with better error handling and design)
    - No design patterns used at this point, but I think the Builder and Director pattern is a good choice for the MediaFileModel

**Week 2:**

~~Literally just a buffer week to catch up on the project and fix bugs.~~
1. 05.06 - Move to own repo, check if there's a possibility to move the git history (30 min)
    - Yes there's a possibility to move the git history but I dont want to do this because Im worried about to much commits at one day
2. 06.06 - Plan the following days, refactor "planning section" to a separate .md, write some retrospective notes (1h)
    - Add a docs folder with planning and developing
    - Add Retrospektive for KW22 and KW23
    - Checked the missing features for my Plan
    - Add steps for the upcoming week
    - Remove the Planning from the root README.md
3. 07.06 - Implement test cases to preview Medias (Videos, PDFs and Images) (1h)
    - Delete files that I accidentally added to the git repository
    - Add tests for pdfPreview, imagePreview and videoPreview
    - Create a MediaPreviewView a VideoJsPlayer and a PdfViewer for the upcoming logic that I'll implement
    - 
4. 08.06 - Implement Media preview (PDFs, Videos and Images), Add a "Header" into the UI (1h 30min)
    - renamed test methods in MediaPreviewViewTests to follow naming conventions
    - implement VideoJsPlayer without a extra dependency, just use the Html Container from Vaadin
    - Adjust naming in the testVideoJsPlayer to follow naming conventions, change name of VideoJsPlayer to VideoPlayer
    - remove the VideoJsPlayer libary
    - impelemt PdfViewer without a extra dependency, just use the Html Container from Vaadin (guess I need to adjust that later / clearly far away from best practices)
    - 
5. 09.06 - Add tests to edit file Names, Add possibility to Edit File Names (1h)
6. 10.06 - Adjust documentation (+Developer doc), Make a universal artifact (1h)
