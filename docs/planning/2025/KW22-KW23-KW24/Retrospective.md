# Retrospective

KW22-KW23 (Part 1)
- Just plan one weak
- Give you a "bigger timeframe" for the Tasks itself and reduce the overall buffer
- If the upcoming tasks are to different to your Plan before, change the Plan instead with extra buffer
- Its okay to have mistakes in a plan but only if you know how to deal with them
